- information extracting dialogue
- self improving action selection based on feedback
- adapting parameters for current conversations
- focus on self improving action selection based on collecting explicit feedback
    - meta-conversations - representing feedback - so it can be used by multiple models - annotated data
        - similar information extraction to knowledge base
- TODO research on feedback learning across different fields
