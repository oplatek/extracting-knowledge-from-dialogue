# Introduction 

- Conversational agents become common for very simplistic domain
    - simplistic restaurant domain {{ "young2010hidden" | cite }}
    - 
- Conversation agents are either handcrafted, or trained using supervised or reinforcement learning
    - supervised or reinforcement learning should reduce the work 
    - Learning "only" the interface how to communicate and not the knowledge
        - One can learn how to communicate and update the parameters
        - New knowledge
        - Which features of the architecture are failing 
        - Learned not implemented but wanted features
- Out-dating optimal parameters, obsolete knowledge-bases - need for learning
- People care and want to teach the agent - the agent should be teachable - TODO verify in literature
