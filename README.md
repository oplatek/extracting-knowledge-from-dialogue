# Thesis proposal

The goal of this thesis proposal is to review published work, work in progress and future plans.
The review first introduces new research questions in the topic of "Extraction knowledge of spoken dialogue systems".
Later it proposes a solution for the questions.

It is cool that I can use equations but not here:-)
When $$a \ne 0$$, there are two solutions to $$(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
