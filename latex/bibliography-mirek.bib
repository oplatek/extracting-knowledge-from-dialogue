@article{Williams2013,
abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, dialog state tracking deduces information about the user's goal as the dialog progresses, syn-thesizing evidence such as dialog acts over multiple turns with external data sources. Recent approaches have been shown to overcome ASR and SLU errors in some applications. However, there are currently no common testbeds or evaluation mea-sures for this task, hampering progress. The dialog state tracking challenge seeks to address this by providing a heteroge-neous corpus of 15K human-computer di-alogs in a standard format, along with a suite of 11 evaluation metrics. The chal-lenge received a total of 27 entries from 9 research groups. The results show that the suite of performance metrics cluster into 4 natural groups. Moreover, the dialog sys-tems that benefit most from dialog state tracking are those with less discriminative speech recognition confidence scores. Fi-nally, generalization is a key problem: in 2 of the 4 test sets, fewer than half of the entries out-performed simple baselines.},

With Wikipediaâ€™s data becoming cleaned and integrated in a single location, opportunities arise for many new applications. Originally conceived in 2001 as a mainly text-based resource, Wikipedia 1 has collected increasing amounts of structured data, including numbers, dates, coordinates, and many types of relationships, from family trees to the taxonomy of species.

abstract = {In this paper, we train a semantic parser that scales up to Freebase. Instead of relying on annotated logical forms, which is especially expensive to obtain at large scale, we learn from question-answer pairs. The main challenge in this setting is narrowing down the huge number of possible logical predicates for a given question. We tackle this problem in two ways: First, we build a coarse mapping from phrases to predicates using a knowledge base and a large text corpus. Second, we use a bridging operation to generate additional predicates based on neighboring predicates. On the dataset of Cai andYates (2013), despite not having annotated logical forms, our system outperforms their state-of-the-art parser. Additionally, we collected a more realistic and challenging dataset of question-answer pairs and improves over a natural baseline.},

This paper studies the impact of multitask and transfer learning for simple question answering; a setting for which the reasoning required to answer is quite easy, as long as one can retrieve the correct evidence given a question, which can be difficult in large-scale conditions. To this end, we introduce a new dataset of 100k questions that we use in conjunction with existing benchmarks. We conduct our study within the framework of Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015) because this perspective allows us to eventually scale up to more complex reasoning, and show that Memory Networks can be successfully trained to achieve excellent performance.},

While stylistic control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules, statistical methods are likely to be needed for generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human dialogues. Previous work on statistical natural language generation (SNLG) has shown that the grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data; however these data-driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived by humans in the way that the system intended. This paper describes Personage, a highly parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological findings about the linguistic reflexes of personality. We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter estimation models trained on personality-annotated data to predict the generation decisions required to convey any combination of scalar values along the five main dimensions of personality. A human evaluation shows that parameter estimation models produce recognizable stylistic variation along multiple dimensions, on a continuous scale, and without the computational cost incurred by overgeneration techniques.},

However, exact model representation and optimization is computationally intractable. Hence, the practical application of POMDP-based systems requires efficient algorithms and carefully constructed approximations.

We show that in deployed dialog systems with real users, as in laboratory experiments, users adapt to the system's lexical and syntactic choices. We also show that the system's lexical and syntactic choices, and consequent user adaptation, can have an impact on recognition of task-related concepts. This means that system prompt formulation, even in flexible input dialog systems, can be used to guide users into producing utterances conducive to task success.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639298},
	abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to the use of lexical entrainment in Spoken Dialog Systems. This approach aims to increase the dialog success rate by adapting the lexical choices of the system to the user's lexical choices. If the system finds that the users lexical choice degrades the performance, it will try to establish a new conceptual pact, proposing other words that the user may adopt, in order to be more successful in task completion. The approach was implemented and tested in two different systems. Tests showed a relative dialog estimated error rate reduction of 10\% and a relative reduction in the average number of turns per session of 6\%.},

	abstract = {Conversational participants tend to immediately and unconsciously adapt to each other's language styles: a speaker will even adjust the number of articles and other function words in their next utterance in response to the number in their partner's immediately preceding utterance. This striking level of coordination is thought to have arisen as a way to achieve social goals, such as gaining approval or emphasizing difference in status. But has the adaptation mechanism become so deeply embedded in the language-generation process as to become a reflex? We argue that fictional dialogs offer a way to study this question, since authors create the conversations but don't receive the social benefits (rather, the imagined characters do). Indeed, we find significant coordination across many families of function words in our large movie-script corpus. We also report suggestive preliminary findings on the effects of gender and other features; e.g., surprisingly, for articles, on average, characters adapt more to females than to males.},
