@article{Williams2013,
abstract = {In a spoken dialog system, dialog state tracking deduces information about the user's goal as the dialog progresses, syn-thesizing evidence such as dialog acts over multiple turns with external data sources. Recent approaches have been shown to overcome ASR and SLU errors in some applications. However, there are currently no common testbeds or evaluation mea-sures for this task, hampering progress. The dialog state tracking challenge seeks to address this by providing a heteroge-neous corpus of 15K human-computer di-alogs in a standard format, along with a suite of 11 evaluation metrics. The chal-lenge received a total of 27 entries from 9 research groups. The results show that the suite of performance metrics cluster into 4 natural groups. Moreover, the dialog sys-tems that benefit most from dialog state tracking are those with less discriminative speech recognition confidence scores. Fi-nally, generalization is a key problem: in 2 of the 4 test sets, fewer than half of the entries out-performed simple baselines.},

	abstract = {Multi-style training, using data which emulates a variety of possible test scenarios, is a popular approach towards robust acoustic modeling. However acoustic models capable of exploiting large amounts of training data in a comparatively short amount of training time are essential. In this paper we tackle the problem of reverberant speech recognition using 5500 hours of simulated reverberant data. We use time-delay neural network ({TDNN}) architecture, which is capable of tackling long-term interactions between speech and corrupting sources in reverberant environments. By sub-sampling the outputs at {TDNN} layers across time steps, training time is substantially reduced. Combining this with distributed-optimization we show that the {TDNN} can be trained in 3 days using up to 32 {GPUs}. Further, {iVectors} are used as an input to the neural network to perform instantaneous speaker and environment adaptation. Finally, recurrent neural network language models are applied to the lattices to further improve the performance. Our system is shown to provide state-of-the-art results in the {IARPA} {ASpIRE} challenge, with 26.5\% {WER} on the dev Jest set.},

Currently, developing task-oriented dialogue systems requires creating multiple components and typically this involves either a large amount of handcrafting, or acquiring labelled datasets and solving a statistical learning problem for each component. In this work we introduce a neural network-based text-in, text-out end-to-end trainable dialogue system along with a new way of collecting task-oriented dialogue data based on a novel pipe-lined Wizard-of-Oz framework. This approach allows us to develop dialogue systems easily and without making too many assumptions about the task at hand. The results show that the model can converse with human subjects naturally whilst helping them to accomplish tasks in a restaurant search domain.},

	abstract = {Recent work in natural language generation has begun to take linguistic variation into account, developing algorithms that are capable of modifying the system's linguistic style based either on the user's linguistic style or other factors, such as personality or politeness. While stylistic control has traditionally relied on handcrafted rules, statistical methods are likely to be needed for generation systems to scale to the production of the large range of variation observed in human dialogues. Previous work on statistical natural language generation (SNLG) has shown that the grammaticality and naturalness of generated utterances can be optimized from data; however these data-driven methods have not been shown to produce stylistic variation that is perceived by humans in the way that the system intended. This paper describes Personage, a highly parameterizable language generator whose parameters are based on psychological findings about the linguistic reflexes of personality. We present a novel SNLG method which uses parameter estimation models trained on personality-annotated data to predict the generation decisions required to convey any combination of scalar values along the five main dimensions of personality. A human evaluation shows that parameter estimation models produce recognizable stylistic variation along multiple dimensions, on a continuous scale, and without the computational cost incurred by overgeneration techniques.},

Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, {ImageNet}) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on {ImageNet} from 87.6\% to 93.2\% and from 88.0\% to 93.8\% on Omniglot compared to competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.},
