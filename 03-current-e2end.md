# Current State of the Art in End-to-end Conversational Systems
- why end-to-end systems?
    - trainable by:
        - reinforcement learning - directly applying latent feedback - does not need to be understood
        - supervised learning - feedback stored in structured way
    - easy-to-experiment with thanks to toolkits for RNN/DNN
